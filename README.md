I am a driven and versatile professional with a proven track record of success in various areas of communication, including radio and television production, audio-visual specialization, and project management ✅

Known for my self-motivation, results-oriented approach, continuous improvement mindset, and ability to innovate🔥

Seeking to expand my skill set and take on new challenges, I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS 💻

Now, I am eager to apply these skills to a dynamic company as a Junior Front-end Developer 🚀
