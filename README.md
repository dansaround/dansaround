# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

**Frontend Developer** — React, Next.js & TypeScript.

I build production-ready web apps with a modern stack. My background in communications and marketing means I care about the *why* behind the code, not just the how.

Based in Peru · Remote-first · Open to opportunities worldwide.
